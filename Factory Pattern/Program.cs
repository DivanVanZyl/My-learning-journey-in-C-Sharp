/*
 * There are some limitations to constuctors, therefore the factory pattern may be usefull.
 * For example, we cannot destinguish between constructors, based on variable names passed. So then you generally have to introduce some other type to distinguish
 * In the above, there is more paramaters in the constructor than is ideal.
 * 
 * 2 types of factories: Proper and abstract.
 * 
 * A factory is essentially a method that returns instances of an object, using a private constructor.
